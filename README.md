# Compliments As A Service

A nicer version of [F**K Off As A Service](https://www.foaas.com/) where somebody using the API makes a call to a GET endpoint, passing in one or many parameters and displaying a compliment based on those parameters. 

CAAS checks the property on the request header sent to it by the user. If the user made the request in the browser, they get back a HTML page with a Bootstrapped message. Otherwise the user is sent a JSON response.
